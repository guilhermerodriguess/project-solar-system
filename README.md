# Project Solar System

Hello! Welcome to my Solar System project repository. In this project, I developed a model of the solar system, where you can see all the planets of the solar system rendered on the screen, as well as cards with information about space missions.

## Requirements Developed

1. I created the Header component, which renders the main title of the page.

2. I created the SolarSystem component, which is responsible for rendering the solar system.

3. I created the Title component, which is responsible for rendering a title.

4. I rendered the Title component inside the SolarSystem component.

5. I created the PlanetCard component, which is responsible for rendering a planet's information.

6. I have rendered a list with the planets of the solar system inside the SolarSystem component.

7. I created the Missions component, which is responsible for rendering information about space missions.

8. I rendered the Title component inside the Missions component.

9. I created the MissionCard component, which is responsible for rendering the information of a space mission.

10. I've rendered a list of space missions within the Missions component.
